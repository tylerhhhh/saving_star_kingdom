# IMPORTANT!

Before working on the html file:
1. Ensure nobody else is currently working on the html file
2. Pull the latest version of the html file (GitHub Desktop is reccomended)

Before comitting the html file:
1. In Twine, go to Build > Publish to file
2. Save your latest version as a seperate html file, incrementing the version number
   Eg. Finish working on saving_star_kingdom_v1? => Publish as saving_star_kingdom_v2
3. Make sure your new published file is stored in your local repository
4. In GitHub desktop, commit your new file and select Push to Origin

Proper file management and naming conventions are crucial!
Accidentally overwriting someone else's work causes setbacks, and if something breaks, it's important to have a version history that we can retrace to a working point. 

Thank You!
